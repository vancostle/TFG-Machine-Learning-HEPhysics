This code contains two problems: whether the Lb0 decay to p,K,ee, from LHCb data, and one simulation of a banc problem (whether a person subscribes to a term deposit). The first one is the main problem and the second one is only a personal trainment as a begginer in this gorgeous field of ML, were the data was extrated from a webpage mentioned in the README.
